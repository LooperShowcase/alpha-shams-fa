    info about eminem:
    <hr><br>he is from the U.S.,he was born in 17th of october
    1972,he was a white rapper and that made it hard for him,so he made the
    song the real slim shady in his first album,and in his second album he
    went to california with his C.D and he met dr.dre on the theater,<br>and
    because he is white dr.dre told him this is his last chance to shine and
    if the fans did not love him he can't sing ever again in his life so he
    made the song lose yourself about his journey,and because his wife went to
    jail he made a song for his daughter because she wont stop crying called
    mockingbird. and he made 344 songs. and his fastest song called rap god
    and because of this song he got an award called rap god.
